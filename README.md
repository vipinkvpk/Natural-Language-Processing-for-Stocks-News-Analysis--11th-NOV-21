# Natural-Language-Processing-for-Stocks-News-Analysis--11th-NOV-21

In this hands-on project, we will train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform stocks sentiment analysis. Natural language processing (NLP) works by converting words (text) into numbers, these numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict peopleâ€™s sentiment towards a particular company or stock. The algorithm could be used automatically understand the sentiment from public tweets, which could be used as a factor while making buy/sell decision of securities.


                Objectives
Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
Understand the concept of tokenizer
Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model
Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
Build and train the deep learning model
Assess the performance of the trained model


              PROJECT OUTCOMES

Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, perform tokenization and padding

Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM

Train the deep learning model and assess its performance
